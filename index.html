  <p class="bible">Matthew 25:41 KJV  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
  prepared for the devil and his angels:

  </p>

  <p class="bible">Ezekiel 28:11-19 KJV  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  (12)  Son of man, take up a lamentation upon
  the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in
  beauty.  (13)  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and
  the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the
  workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.  (14)  Thou art the
  anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and
  down in the midst of the stones of fire.  (15)  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till
  iniquity was found in thee.  (16)  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence,
  and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O
  covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.  (17)  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
  corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that
  they may behold thee.  (18)  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of
  thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to
  ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.  (19)  All they that know thee among the people shall be
  astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >Romans 5:12-14 KJV  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
  men, for that all have sinned:  (13)  (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no
  law.  (14)  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of
  Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 5:17 KJV  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and
of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Timothy 1:10 KJV  But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:

  </p>

<p class="bible" >John 3:35-36 KJV  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  (36)  He that believeth on the
Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 2:7 KJV  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal
life:

</p>

<p class="bible">1 John 3:13-15 KJV  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  (14)  We know that we have passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.  (15)  Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 22:14-15 KJV  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into the city.  (15)  For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 20:7-10 KJV  And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,  (8)  And
shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together
to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  (9)  And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and
compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured
them.  (10)  And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the
false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 21:8 KJV  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which
is the second death.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 20:14 KJV  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

</p>

<p class="bible">Revelation 21:3-4 KJV  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he
will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.  (4)  And God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

</p>

<p class="bible">Jude 1:7 KJV  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to
fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Peter 2:6 KJV  And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them
an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;

</p>

<p class="text">Satan will love us to think that God is wicked as himself.

</p>

<p class="text">Satan and his emisaries represent God as even worse than themselves,… The great deceiver endavors to shift his own
horrible cruelty of character upon our heavenly father.

</p>

<p class="text">How repugnant to every emotion of love and mercy, and even to our sense of justice, is the doctrine that the wicked dead
are tormented with fire and brimstone in an eternally burning hell; that for the sins of a brief earthly life they are
to suffer torture aslong as God shall live. Yet this doctrine has been widely taught and is still embodied in many of
the creeds of Christendom. <b> Great Controversy 534 </b>

<p class="bible">1 Samuel 1:11 KJV  And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine
handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will
give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Samuel 1:22 KJV  But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned,
and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Samuel 1:28 KJV  Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he
worshipped the LORD there.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 13:24-30 KJV  Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which
sowed good seed in his field:  (25)  But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his
way.  (26)  But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  (27)  So the
servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then
hath it tares?  (28)  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go
and gather them up?  (29)  But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
 (30)  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye
together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 13:36-39 KJV  Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him,
saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  (37)  He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the
good seed is the Son of man;  (38)  The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares
are the children of the wicked one;  (39)  The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world;
and the reapers are the angels.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:22-24 KJV  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  (23)  But every man in
his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.  (24)  Then cometh the end, when
he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority
and power.

</p>

<p class="bible">Luke 16:14 KJV  And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Luke 16:19-31 KJV  There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
day:  (20)  And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,  (21)  And desiring
to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  (22)  And
it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
was buried;  (23)  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his
bosom.  (24)  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  (25)  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou
in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art
tormented.  (26)  And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass
from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.  (27)  Then he said, I pray thee
therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:  (28)  For I have five brethren; that he may
testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.  (29)  Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and
the prophets; let them hear them.  (30)  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they
will repent.  (31)  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.

<p class="bible">Ezekiel 33:7-11 KJV  So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt
hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.  (8)  When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I
require at thine hand.  (9)  Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from
his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.  (10)  Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto
the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how
should we then live?  (11)  Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked;
but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of
Israel?
